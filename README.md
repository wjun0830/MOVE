# Pytorch Implementation for "Minority-Oriented Vicinity Expansion with Attentive Aggregation for Video Long-Tailed Recognition" (AAAI 2023) 

[Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13471) | [Download Imbalanced-MiniKinetics200](http://115.145.172.53:1215/AAAI_2023_MOVE_longtailed_minikinetics/index.html)

## 1. Requirements & Environments
To run the code, you need to install requirements below.
We suggest to work with torch version (1.2 ~ 1.7.1).
Other versions may work fine but we haven't tested them.

``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``


## 2. Training & Evaluation
Please refer to subdirectories for training each [VideoLT](VideoLT) and [Imbalanced-MiniKinetics200](Imbalanced-MiniKinetics200) dataset.
