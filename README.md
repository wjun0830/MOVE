## 1. Requirements & Environments
To run the code, you need to install requirements below.
We suggest to work with torch version (1.2 ~ 1.7.1).
Other versions may work fine but we haven't tested them.

``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``


## 2. Training & Evaluation
Please refer to subdirectories for training each [VideoLT](VideoLT) and [Imbalanced-MiniKinetics200](Imbalanced-MiniKinetics200) dataset.
